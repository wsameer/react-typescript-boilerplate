### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `npm build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm lint` or `yarn lint`

This will trigger

 - `esLint`: a linter that finds and fixes problems in your JavaScript/TypeScript code.
 - `styleLint`: a linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.

### `npm clean` or `yarn clean`

This will remove `build, coverage and node_modules`folders for a clean start.
